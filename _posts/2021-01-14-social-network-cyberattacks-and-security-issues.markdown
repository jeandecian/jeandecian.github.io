Chapter 1 of « Médias sociaux : perspectives sur les défis liés à la cybersécurité, la gouvernementalité algorithmique et l’intelligence artificielle » by Schallum Pierre and Fehmi Jaafar.

Abstract : In the last five years, multiple cyberattacks targeting social networks were reported. Moreover, medias and security experts disseminated a set of serious security issues in social networks. In fact, the amounts of personal information and sensitive data that may be managed by social networks make them an ideal target for hackers and hacking organisations. [...], we will review the main social network cyberattacks and security issues reported since 2016. Our goal is to present a deep and accurate analysis of scenarios and results of these cyberattacks and security issues in order to determine a set of lessons learned and recommendations to enhance the security posture of the social networks.
